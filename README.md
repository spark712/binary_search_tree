## Binary Search Tree

B binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree. A binary tree is a type of data structure for storing data such as numbers in an organized way.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree](wikipedia)
